How to read the decision tree created by scikit-learn:

1. Identify parameter decribed by the node:
    Orientation of substituents: Represented by the value in the donor vector i.e. C-2 refers to value describing the configuration of the C-2 substituent in a Mills projection.
    Leaving group: OHE as smiles i.e. a node with OHE_lg_*Br asks if the donor is a glycosyl bromide.
    Donor substituents: OHE as smiles i.e. a node with OHE_C3_*OC([CH3])=O asks if the donor has OAc on C-3.
    Solvent: OHE as cas number i.e. a node with 75-05-8 asks if the solvent is acetonitril.
    Activator: OHE as a smiles i.e. a node with O=S(=O)(O)O asks if the activator is TfOH.
    Temperature: Scalar in Celsius.

2. How to read the conditions?
    All nodes quiries whether a parameter is smaller than or equal to (<=) a scalar and should be interpreted as follows:
    Orientation of substituents: Refers he value decribed above which can be -1 (negative configuration), 0 (deoxy), or +1 (positive configuration).
    OHE parameters: The OHE representations are binary thus can take on the values 0 (not present) and 1 (present)
    Temperature: The temperature is above or below a threshold.

    If the expression in the node is True follow the arrow to left, if False follow the arrow to the right,
